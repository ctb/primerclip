Fix zero-trim flag and mate fields update to avoid changing fields for alingments
which were nonmapped prior to trimming (trimdToZeroLength flag observed set for
alignments which were not trimmed as they were nonmapped in input SAM).

MN00139:210:000H2CV3V:1:12103:22023:2896
Should a secondary alignment which is trimmed to zero length be dropped from the
output, or is there a flag setting which will allow it to remain in the output
SAM file??
